//######################
//Done: Create a component containing one line
//Done: Create buttons to add or delete a new line in the garden
//Done: Add the "add" and "delete" buttons in the latest added line and make them dispear from the previous line
//Done :Show the "delete" button when there is at least one line in the view (this.state >0), use of a ternary operator "?"" to display the "removeButton" or to hide it 
//Done: Change the ground image
//Done : Create a vegetable test object
//Done : Add a <Modal/> component to call on click on a line
//Done : Use the map() method to loop through this object and display them on a modal element
//Done : On click on a vegetable from modal, add it into the lines
//To Do : On click on a vegetable from modal, add it into the specific line it was clicked from
//To Do: Refactorize this component into several components
//To Do: Add animations + sounds around the garden area
//To Do: Maybe in another component : add a fruit/vegetable onClick on a line
